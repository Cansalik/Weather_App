# Weather Project

My Weather app, which I developed using the OpenWeatherMap API, allows users to easily see daily, hourly and weekly weather information.

The app provides daily weather information for the location specified by the user. This information includes daily weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability.

In addition, if users want to see weather information for a specific time interval, the app fulfills this request. Users can examine temperature changes, humidity and other weather parameters between specific hours.

Weekly weather forecasts are also available. The app provides users with weather forecasts for the coming week, helping them plan ahead.

The app has a user-friendly interface and allows users to easily enter their location and select the weather information they want.

We visualize weather data in the form of graphs, icons or text so that users can understand the information more easily.

We also provide automatic updates. Weather forecasts are constantly changing, so our app always provides users with the most up-to-date information.

This app can be useful for anyone who wants to keep track of the weather. It can be a great help especially for travelers, athletes and those who work in weather-dependent jobs.
